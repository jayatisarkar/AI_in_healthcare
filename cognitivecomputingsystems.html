      <h4 class="text-center">What is IBM Waton?</h3>
      <p>Watson is a supercomputer built by IBM to analyse enormous amounts of data that can then be used by researchers. It combines artificial intelligence and complex analytical software to be capable of answering potentially any question you may have. Watson process information at a rate of 80 teraflops and accesses 90 servers storing 200 million pages of information in order to replicate a human brain. Within healthcare, Watson is capable of searching through huge sets of patient records and medical reports and uses hypothesis generation and evidence-based learning to help doctors make better decisions. <sup>[1]</sup> </p>

      <h4 class="text-center">What is Watson's healthcare hierarchy?</h3>
       <p>Watson's healthcare hierarchy is described as below:</p>
       <p>The first level begins with assistance that the computer would be able to give researchers when treating and diagnosing patients. For example, a medical professional would describe symptoms and add them to the system. Watson would then use natural language processing to identify key information, particularly any medical terminology. <sup> [2] </sup> </p>
       <p>At the second level, the system combines patient data, current medications and all available data from tests to form hypotheses. Then specific conditions will be mapped to the patient based on treatment guidelines, online medical data and articles. </p>
       <p>The third level is composed of decisions on potential diagnoses for the patient, based upon the data inputted earlier and the resulting patterns that have been analysed.</p>
       <p>The highest tier is known as discovery and is where Watson searches through huge numbers of papers on and relating to the condition being studied.<br/><a href="#" class="scroll-top back-to-top">&uarr;</a></p>

          <h4 class="text-center">What is AtomNet?</h3>
          <p>AtomNet is the first deep convolutional neural network for structure-based, “rational” drug design that includes information about the target to make predicitions. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help discover new medicines by predicting the bioactivity of small molecules for drug discovery.</p>

            <p>
          <h4 class="text-center">How are new drugs discovered?</h3>
          <p>When a protein plays a crucial role in a disease, it is called a "target", for example, proteins that grow tumours and proteins that help viruses infect human cells. The goal in drug research is to create molecules (called "ligands") that strongly interact with these targets and reduce their effect.</p>
          <p>Lock-oriented techniques or, in other words “structure-based” algorithms, identify the structure of the target protein to guide their predictions. This approach works for completely new targets and is therefore very useful. It has led to the development of a variety of software packages, such as Dock and Glide. The accuracy is the main limitation of these technologies, as a high rate of false-positives can be found in these techniques which is why many researchers have remained skeptical about their usefulness. </p>
          <p> Key-oriented techniques or “ligand-based” algorithms have also been explored. Many examples of ligands that are already known to bind to a target are considered and even better ligands can be predicted from that data by technologies such as ROCS (a powerful virtual screening tool capable of quickly identifying active compounds via ashape comparison) and LINGOs (a text-based molecular similarity search). The main limitation is that these technologies require researchers to have already discovered at least some ligands for a target. However, there are very few known ligands for unsolved and challenging drug discovery targets. In this case, these methods are expected to produce poor predictions.</p>
          <h4 class="text-center">How does AtomNet discover new drugs?</h3>
          <p>AtomNet does this through a structure-based, rational, highly accurate drug design system. Candidate molecules for new drug discovery targets can be predicted by this system and these predictions have a high chance of proving correct and providing researchers with what they need from a virtual drug discovery method.</p>
          <p>AtomNet is excellent at understanding complicated concepts by dividing each problem into smaller pieces of information. This property is the reason why the world’s best results for image classification and deep-rooted problems are produced by convolutional networks. For example, a convolutional model can learn to recognise faces by first learning a set of basic features in an image, such as edges. Then, the model can identify different body parts such as eyes, ears and mouth by combining the edges. Finally, the model can learn to recognise faces by combining those parts. AtomNet does something similar except with chemical structures. <sup>[1]</sup>  </p>

          <p>
          <h4 class="text-center">What are convolutional neural networks?</h3>
          <p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of feed-forward neural network which tries to mimic the pattern of neuron connections inside the visual cortex of an animal. CNNs have been used in the field of computer vision for a long time but have CNNs gained more popularity recenyly in a diverse range of applications, from natural language processing to medical image analysis. The power of a CNN is due to its deep architecture, which enables a CNN to extract a list of perceptive features at different levels of abstraction. </p>
          <p>Similarly, AtomNet might learn that proteins and ligands are made up of a variety of specialised chemical structures. This would be an exciting result because it suggest that AtomNet was learning fundamental concepts in organic chemistry by itself - no human ever taught AtomNet the building blocks of organic chemistry. AtomNet discovered them itself by studying vast quantities of target and ligand data. The patterns it independently observed are so fascinatingly foundational that they are studied in academic courses. <sup>[2]</sup><br/><a href="#" class="scroll-top back-to-top">&uarr;</a></p>

         <p>Medical Sieve is a long-term project which aims to construct a cognitive assistant with high-level multimodal analytics and reasoning capabilities able to assist in making clinical decisions in the fields of radiology and cardiology. The sieve will have a fundamental understanding of diseases and how they can be interpreted in modalities such as X-ray, ultrasounds, CT, MRI etc. </p>

          <h4 class="text-center">What is the aim of Medical Sieve?</h3>
          <p>The aim of this project is to build a sieve that filters vital clinical imaging and diagnostic information to produce summaries that are anomaly-driven and suggestions that greatly decrease the viewing load of clinicians without having a negative impact on diagnosis. Based on statistics, one common issue among radiologists is eye fatigue due to the enourmous number of visual checks they carry out on images every day. For example, around 200 cases may be considered by a radiologist in an emergency room per day, and this number can reach up to 3000 images, particularly in lower body CT angiography.  <sup>[1]</sup> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <h4 class="text-center">How does Medical Sieve work?</h3>
          <p>Medical Sieve is an image-guided informatics system that acts as a medical sieve, filtering the necessary clinical information needed for physicians to diagnose their patients and find the best treatment plans. Clinical data about patients is gathered from various enterprise systems in hospitals including EMR (electronic medical record) which is the digital version of traditional paper-based medical record for an individual, and radiology/cardiology PACs (picture archiving and communication system) using HL7 and DICOM adapters.</p>
          <p>Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is used all over the world to exchange medical images, escalate the connectivity of radiological devices and develop modern radiological imaging. Before the DICOM standard became broadly selected, each manufacturer had its own image format and communication protocol. This expansion and growth of formats and protocols made it very difficult to create third-party software to manage or study medical content, or to connect hardware devices from different manufacturers. <sup>[2]</sup>  </p>
          <p>Health Level-7 or HL7 is a set of international standards which allows clinical and administrative data transaction between software applications. These applications are used by different healthcare providers. Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI) characterises communication functions with no regard for their internal structure and technology. This model has 7 layers and HL7 standards focus on the application layer, the 7th layer of OSI, and specifies the shared protocol and interface methods in a communication network. <sup>[3]</sup> </p>
          <p>Then, advanced medical text and image processing pattern recognition and machine learning techniques guided by sophisticated clinical knowledge will be used to process clinical data about the patient and to obtain valid and worthwhile summaries showing the anomalies. Finally, advanced summaries of imaging studies will be created to represent important anomalies that are identified in various point of views.<br/><a href="#" class="scroll-top back-to-top">&uarr;</a></p>
